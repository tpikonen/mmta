Description: Minimalistic mail transport agent for desktop systems
 mmta is an ultra-simple mail transport agent (MTA) focusing on small
 code size and ease of configuration. It does only local delivery by
 itself, but can be configured to forward mail to an SMTP-server
 using external programs such as msmtp.
 .
 The functionality of mmta is limited by design to receiving a message
 and immediately storing it either to a mailbox of a local receiver, 
 or to a user specific spool directory. Attempts at forwarding mail
 destined to external hosts are made periodically with a cron job.
