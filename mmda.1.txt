NAME
----
mmda - a minimal mail delivery agent

SYNOPSIS
--------
mmda < deliver | forward | send > <username>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

mmda reads an email message from standard input and either delivers it to a
given local user honoring the users .forward file ('deliver' and 'forward'
subcommands) or tries to send the mailqueue of the given user using external
programs ('send' subcommand).

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------
deliver::
	Delivers mail to a local user honoring the contents of users 
	.forward file. If the message is forwarded to an external host 
	(i.e. .forward contains a line of type user@external.org), then
	the message is put into the mail queue of the user using the 
	external 'queue-mail' command (or script) which is read from 
	either local or global configuration directory. 
	Local delivery is made to an mbox-style local mailbox 
	to /var/mail/username. If this mailbox does not exists, it is created.

forward::
	Same as 'deliver', but an attempt at sending the mail queue of the
	receiving user is made immediately after delivery.

send::
	An attempt at sending the mail queue of the given user is made
	by using the 'send-queue' command obtained from the configuration.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
0::
	Successful execution.

1::
	Wrong number of command line arguments given.

2::
	<username> is a privileged user (uid < 1000).

3::
	<username> is invalid.

4::
	Dropping of root privileges was not successful.
