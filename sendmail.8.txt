SENDMAIL(8)
===========

NAME
----
sendmail - Minimal Mail Transfer Agent sendmail interface

SYNOPSIS
--------
sendmail [option ...] [--] [recipients ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Minimal Mail Transfer Agent (MMTA) is an implementation of the sendmail(1)
command intended for desktop and embedded systems and servers which only need
to send mail.  It can do local mail delivery using mmda(1) and send mail to
external hosts via external programs like msmtp(1). Since MMTA does not
function as a daemon, mail cannot be received from outside. MMTA implements
most, but not all, command line options specified in the LSB sendmail
specification[1]. 

OPTIONS
-------
-bm::
        Read mail from standard input and deliver it to recipient addresses.
        This is the default mode of operation also without any options given.

-oem or -em:: 
        Mail errors back to sender (default).

-oep or -ep::
        Write errors to stderr.

-om::
        Mail a copy of the message to the sender if the sender appears in 
        an alias expansion. 

-t::
        Parse the To:, Cc: and Bcc: headers in the message to obtain 
        recipients. NB! Currently the recipient list obtained from the 
        headers is appended to the the list of recipients obtained from 
        the command line, unlike in the LSB spec, where the list of addresses
        obtained from the command line is ignored when this option is given.

Options -bp, -bs, -F and -f are not implemented and will result in an immediate
exit with exit status 5. Options -i, -oi, -odb, -odf and other unknown options
are silently ignored.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
0::
        Delivery to local address or to the mail queue of a local user was
        successful.

5::
        Unimplemented command line option was given.
